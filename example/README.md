# @piwikpro/react-piwik-pro + React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

This example was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

It is linked to the @piwikpro/react-piwik-pro package in the parent directory for development purposes.

You can run `npm install` and then `npm run dev` to test your package.
